Tests for the basic content of a more_about_me.html file of a web site with a particular set of content.

Selenium webdriver for Chrome (a.k.a. the file named chromedriver) must be installed in either:
- in the same directory as chrome.exe on Windows (e.g. C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application)
- in a directory that is included in the PATH on Mac OS X (e.g. /usr/local/bin)
