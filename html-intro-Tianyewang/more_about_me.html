            Last summer holiday, I went to HaiNan with my family. 
            The weather was pleasant! The sky was blue more than I could describe, 
            the sea was blue and bright more than I could believe. 
            Walking by the sea is just like being in the oil painting! 
            We sailed to an island called Xidao. I swam there. 
            Swimming in the sea is quite different from that in a pool. 
            Bedsides swimming, we also had a good meal there. 
            We had a nice seafood dish.And I bought back many beautiful shells. 
            If you want to have a look, you may ask me. Or, we may go to Hainan together, 
            for I am always hoping to come to that place again. I really like that place, 
            a place of blue and brightness.
